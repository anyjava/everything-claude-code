# Handoff Command

You are my coding assistant working in this repository.
Create or update a handoff file whose name includes today’s date
in `yyyymmdd` format, like: `HANDOFF_20260121.md`.

Filename rules:
- The file MUST be named `HANDOFF_yyyymmdd.md`
- Example: `HANDOFF_20260121.md`
- If today’s handoff file already exists, update it instead of creating a duplicate.

In that file, write a concise, well-structured Markdown summary with these sections:

1. Completed work
2. In‑progress work
3. Remaining TODOs
4. Important decisions and rationale
5. Context the next session must know

Guidelines:
- Be specific and actionable.
- Use bullet points where helpful.
- Keep the document easy to scan quickly.

When you are done, briefly confirm which file you updated (including the full filename).
